Don't think so? Consider my list of varied careers\n                  above. If only I had a \"mental coach\" to help me get to these\n                  positions faster, I might have had 30 more roles to include!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  You don't have to be in the \"arts\" to work with me.

Sharing\n                  the weight of recognizing, unpacking, and harnessing talent\n                  with a professional (aka GETTING UNSTUCK) is fundamental to\n                  LASTING growth. This is a highly creative process at its core\n                  and most people rarely get there without this shared\n                  experience.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  But don't take my word for it; read our reviews, (ask me for a\n                  full bio, if you'd like,) have a look through my services and\n                  let's do this.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  <em>Let ME help you, help YOU WIN.</em>\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  (Go ahead, read that 2x!)\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  <p className=\"font\">\n                    <strong>xx Coach Kai</strong>\n                  </p>\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AboutMe\n"],"names":["props","id","className","sticky","items","currentClassName","offset","Link","to","Scroll","type","element","href","AboutMe","_handleWaypointEnter","setState","stickyNav","_handleWaypointLeave","state","render","onEnter","this","onLeave","Helmet","charSet","name","content","rel","src","biopic","alt","React"],"sourceRoot":""}
